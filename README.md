Code for " A Decentralized Approach based on Collaborative Deep Learning for Secure Data Sharing: Beyond Federated Learning"
Overview

Welcome to the repository for the paper titled "A Decentralized Approach based on Collaborative Deep Learning for Secure Data Sharing: Beyond Federated Learning." 

Introduction

This repository contains the code associated with the paper, which presents a decentralized approach using collaborative deep-learning techniques to ensure secure data sharing. This approach goes beyond traditional federated learning by enhancing data privacy and model performance.

Code
The code provided here implements the decentralized collaborative deep learning approach for secure data sharing. It includes scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation,  visualization, fusion types and security part.

Trained Models
Due to the limited size of the repository, the trained models are not included. However, they can be requested from l.alzubaidi@qut.edu.au.
